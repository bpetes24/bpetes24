- 👋 Hi, I’m Braden!
- 👀 I’m a recent Cognitive Science graduate from the University of Georgia with dreams of becoming a UI/UX Designer.
  In addition to programming, I also write sci-fi/fantasy stories and music arrangements for fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the basics of web development through The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever sounds interesting to me. I'd like to make an indie game someday, whether it's a text adventure game or a 2D-scroller.
